# Instructions:
# Make sure to set your APIKEY in environment variable MERAKI_DASHBOARD_API_KEY.
# Script will display and prompt you to select OrgId and NetworkId then ask for a string to match device type.
# Partial matches allowed for device type. Example 'MR' will capture all AP models. 'MR4' will match MR44, MR46, etc.
# To ignore specific devices, create ignorelist.csv in the same path as the script. One name or serial number per line in a single column.
#
# Recommended: Perform a test run with the final line commented to see what will be rebooted and what will be skipped.
# When ready, uncomment last line to enable the rebootDevice API call.
#
# IMPORTANT: Devices will not reboot until the last line is uncommented.
